# My-CNN-app
This is an app I created and is up and running on Heroku .https://project-app-launch.herokuapp.com/ 
This was a project I did in my UC Berkeley Analytics program.
I took various ImageNet Convoluted Neural Nets architectures and ran them through various pictures from the wild, without training them in anyway 
I basically wanted to do out of the shelf test to see which model would work the best for my future work on Deep learning computer vision related projects.
In this app I have various notebooks in html that shows all the code and the various predictions I got from the Imagenet model
This pretrained models were ran in keras framework.
My goal is to start off with a pre trained convnet for my computer vision projects and depending on the dataset that I am working on ( I mean complexity of the problem I am trying to solve) I can fine tune these deep nueral nets by adding more hidden layers, freezing some layers, updating weights at some layers while using the pretrained weights at other layers I can get a good working model that generalizes well with data from the wild.
THis is an ongoing work I enjoy doing on other frameworks like pytorch and caffe as well. The reason being that the codebase of pytorch is very intuitive and easy to code and debug. I find the same with caffe too .
Tensorflow and keras are still amazing with their visual dashborard.
